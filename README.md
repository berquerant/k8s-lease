klock -- manage locks from shell scripts within Kubernetes

# Usage

  klock [flags] -- command [arguments]

klock manages the Kubernetes lease locks from within shell scripts or from the command line.

klock runs the provided command (or a command with arguments) with mutual exclusion guaranteed by a lease.
klock acquires a lock via a holder identity from a lease, which is created if it does not already exist.

The following labels are always applied to leases created by klock:

app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=klock

# Exit status

1 if failure.
The exit status of the given command, if klock is executed it.

# Flags
